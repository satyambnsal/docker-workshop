## Who Are You ?

This workshop is aimed for people with minimum 1-2 year of experience in software development. You should be familiar with very basics of Linux like how to create a directory and file, how to change directory, etc.

I will be using MacOS to write code and run containers. If you want to follow along, please install docker on your machine beforehand.

### Setup Instructions
- For Mac: [Docker Desktop Community](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
- For Linux: [Docker Engine Community](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/)
- For Windows [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/)
  
For Windows user, this [blog post](https://medium.com/@mbyfieldcameron/docker-on-windows-10-home-edition-c186c538dff3)
might be helpful as well.


Do note that containers can take lot of CPU and memory. If your machine RAM size is above 8GB, you will be fine. things can slow down on machines with low CPU and RAM capability.
trying things along with the workshop can also take a lot of bandwidth because we will download a lot of things. be aware of that.
